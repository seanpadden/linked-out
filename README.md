Tired of tons of connection requests from people you don't know on LinkedIn? Introducing LinkedOut!

Easily ignore invites in your connection request list and provide LinkedIn feedback that you don't know who these people are! 

Instructions: 

Navigate to "My Network" tab of LinkedIn where all your spam requests live. 
Copy and paste the code into your Chrome console. 
Hit enter.

Note: this is a joke application and is only built for ignoring all invites.
so only use it if you want to all incoming requests! 

There is no merit to connecting with 30 random people. 
That doesn't help you when trying to navigate your network, it just confuses things more!
